  <p>Flipper is an American television program first broadcast on NBC from September 19, 1964, until April 15, 1967. Flipper, a bottlenose 
    dolphin, is the pet of Porter Ricks, Chief Warden at Coral Key Park and Marine Preserve (a fictional version of John Pennekamp Coral 
    Reef State Park in Key Largo, Florida), and his two young sons, Sandy and Bud. The show has been dubbed an "aquatic Lassie", and a 
    considerable amount of children's merchandise inspired by the show was produced during its first run.</P>
  <h2>Filming locations</h2>
  <p>Flipper was filmed in Miami at Greenwich Studios (at the time called Ivan Tors Studios) at 12100 Ivan Tors Boulevard in Miami, Florida, 
    USA and at Key Biscayne, Florida. Nassau was an occasional location, especially for underwater footage. The show was produced in 
    cooperation with the Miami Seaquarium, an aquarium also located on Key Biscayne in Miami.</p>
  <h2>Role of Flipper</h2>
  <p>Flipper was portrayed at first by a female dolphin named Susie, though primarily by another female, Kathy, and occasionally by other 
    females named Patty, Scotty and Squirt. Female dolphins were chosen because they are less aggressive than males and their skins (unlike 
    the skins of male dolphins) are usually free from scars and other disfigurations acquired in altercations with other dolphins, making it 
    easier to have them pass for the identical "Flipper". The five dolphins performed all of Flipper's scenes except the famous tail walk, 
    a trick they were unable to master completely. A male dolphin named Clown was brought in for scenes involving the tail walk. The famous 
    "voice" of Flipper was actually the doctored song of a kookaburra bird.</p>
  <h2>Animal cast</h2>
  <p><strong>Flipper:</strong> Flipper is a dolphin and the companion animal of the Ricks family. Flipper is an extraordinarily intelligent 
    dolphin who helps enforce regulations in the Preserve, assists Porter Ricks with rescues at sea, and keeps a watchful eye on Sandy and 
    Bud, who he has rescued or helped rescue from danger on numerous occasions. Flipper was portrayed by five different dolphins; the most 
    commonly used ones were named "Kathy" and "Susie."<br><br>
    <strong>Pelican Pete:</strong> A pelican named Pete, depicted in the original movie as Sandy's pet before he met Flipper, had a 
    recurring role on the show and appeared in several episodes. <br><br>
    <strong>Additional animal cast members:</strong> Other animals appearing on the show included a Chesapeake Bay Retriever named Spray 
    (real name was Chobee from Okeechobee, Florida) (seen only in a few early episodes), a seal, a baby elephant, alligators, a female 
    albino dolphin (whose baby Flipper fathered during her only appearance, in the "White Dolphin" episode); and another female dolphin, 
    introduced at the end of the second season, dubbed "Lorelei" by the Ricks family. Lorelei became Flipper's "girlfriend".
